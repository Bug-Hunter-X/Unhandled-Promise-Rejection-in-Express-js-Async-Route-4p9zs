This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: improper handling of asynchronous operations within routes.  The `bug.js` file shows an example where an asynchronous function might throw an error.  The error is logged to the console, but no proper response is sent to the client, leading to potential crashes or incomplete responses. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.
